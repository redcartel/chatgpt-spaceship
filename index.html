    <hr />
    <p>This was coded in 25 ChatGPT4 prompts and 2 ChatGPT3.5 prompts.</p>
    <p>
      After about 20 prompts, it started making obvious errors, using the wrong
      names for its own functions and variables, that kind of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visual styling is all from ChatGPT but after it was all done, I
      tweaked some velocity etc. constants to improve gameplay. (A little, it
      works better with a gamepad than with the keyboard)
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't do much to clean up the source from how ChatGPT wrote it, you can
      take a look.
